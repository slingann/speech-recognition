# speech-recogntion
a website that uses speech recognition on the web speech api to recognize what you're saying, made using the [hackclub workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/speech_recognition/)

currently the voice is very robotic, researching to see if i can use another tool to make the response voice more realistic
